Description: Here we provide tools for the computation and factorization of high-dimensional
	     tensor products that are formed by smaller matrices. The methods are based on
	     properties of Kronecker products (Searle 1982, p. 265, ISBN-10: 0470009616). 
	     We evaluated this methodology by benchmark testing and illustrated its use in 
	     Gaussian Linear Models ('Lopez-Cruz et al., 2024') <doi:10.1093/g3journal/jkae001>.
